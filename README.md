# College Management Web Application

This project is a **Node.js**-based web application designed to facilitate the management of student and course data for a college. It provides an intuitive interface for college administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student and course records. The application leverages **Express.js** for server-side functionality and **Handlebars.js** as the templating engine for dynamic content rendering.

## Features

- **List and View Records**:
  - Display a complete list of students and courses.
  - View individual student and course details.
- **Add New Records**:
  - Add new students and courses through user-friendly forms.
- **Edit Existing Records**:
  - Update student and course information using their respective forms.
- **Delete Records**:
  - Remove student or course entries by ID.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**:
  - Dynamic navigation bar highlighting the active route using Handlebars helpers.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**:
  - Handles scenarios where no records are found or server errors occur.
- **Deployment**:
  - Hosted on **Cyclic.sh** for easy online access: [Live App](https://red-combative-elk.cyclic.app/).

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routes and server logic.
- **Handlebars.js**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic content.
